		<p>The High School Computing Club aims to bring together students with similar interests, where the CSE students are there to provide guidance and high school students support each other in developing their skills and expanding their knowledge.</p>

		<p>The motivation for running High School Computing Club came when a bunch of CSE students tutored at CSE's winter school. They noticed that a lot of high school students are enthusiastic about computing, but there was little personal support available when they try to learn on their own.</p>
